# What is the Biomass Succession Extension?

Biomass succession simulates changes in the biomass of each cohort dependent upon age, competition, and disturbance. The extension has been a popular tool when the focus of the research is on aboveground forest dynamics and when consideration of below ground dynamics is not important. Relative to other succession extensions, it is relatively simple. 

The Biomass Succession Extension generally follows the methods outlined in Scheller and Mladenoff (2004). Biomass Succession calculates how cohorts reproduce, age, and die and how cohort biomass (g m-2) changes through time. The Biomass Succession extension also tracks dead biomass over time, divided into two pools: woody and leaf litter. 

# Features

- [x] Relatively few parameters organized by ecoregions.
- [x] Loads the Climate Library, for incorporating monthly or daily climate forecasts for running climate-dependent disturbance extensions.

# Example Files

LANDIS-II requires a global parameter file for your scenario, and then different parameter files for each extension.
